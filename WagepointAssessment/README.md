# Frontend Developer Assessment

## Description

We like coffee.

So, we built an app to fetch coffee for people from our favorite barista.
The app keeps track of coffee ordered; what the balance is for each user; what users have paid for already; and what is still owed.

## Data

We've got the following data

-   `data/prices.json` - provided by our barista. Has details of what beverages are available, and what their prices are.
-   `data/orders.json` - list of beverages ordered by users of the app.
-   `data/payments.json` - list of payments made by users paying for items they have purchased.

## Requirements

-   Load the list of prices - Load the orders
-   Calculate the total cost of each user's orders - Load the payments
-   Calculate the total payment for each user
-   Calculate what each user now owes
-   Return a JSON string containing the results of this work.

## Tech stack

-   You should use `React`.
-   You can use any state management library. For e.g. Redux or React.Context
-   You can use CSS frameworks. Material design
-   Please load the JSONs asynchronously either by hosting on an external server or a local `Node.js` server

## Requirements

-   Write production-ready code.
-   Document how to run the application.
-   Publish the source code into a `private` repo on GitHub (using your own personal account) and share it with us.
